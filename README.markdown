check_permissions.py [path] [username]

Check is <path> is accessible by <user>
If not, highlight which permissions are conflicting
Path defaults to current working directory
User defaults to current user

---------------------

Users have so many interesting theories it's hard to 
believe. What they can do with making permissions wrong
is simply incredible. That's why I needed a simple tool
to make fixing permissions easier. Welcome to 
check_permissions.py

The tool will highlight in red permissions that matter
and should be fixed.
